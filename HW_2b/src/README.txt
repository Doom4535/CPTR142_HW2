Purpose of program: Complete problem 7.6 (automated pizza ordering)
Includes: order.h order.cpp pizza.h pizza.cpp HW_2b.cpp

This is the second part of HW #2 (prob 7.6), it contains the pizza class 
with an order class and implements a simple STL queue.  This queue currently
only stores orders because nothing has been done to implement when an order
is completed/baked.
